# my dotfiles

Hi.

This is my dotfiles repo. It features:

- hyprland
  - notification daemon: mako
  - lockscreen: hyprlock
  - terminal: kitty
  - background: wpaperd
  - bar-thingy: waybar
  - other: cursorlock (org. hyprlock, for locking cursor)
- nvim
- zsh

I manage my dotfiles with stow, this is why most of the configs are located under `.config/`.
A lot in this setup is only working for specific tasks or looks like it is about to break.

Also this setup is not as nearly as secure as I would like so please don't use this information here to break it :D

## Thanks
